# Arduino-led-table

Customisation from this reop: https://github.com/davidhrbaty/IKEA-LED-Table

## Table
The table was build from an ikea lack table. The matrix is a 10 x 15 led (WS2812B) grid. 
The used arduino is an arduino-mega but with you can also use an arduino uno when you remove some programs, that uses too much memory.  
  
The table has 6 buttons on the sides of the table for controlling. 2 at the front, 2 at the right side and 2 at left side. There is also one button at the bottom to switch the programs.   
A potentiometer controls the brightness of the table.  
  
An android device can be connected using bluetooth. The table uses an HC-05 bluetooth module.
